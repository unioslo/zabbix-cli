# Plugins

The functionality of the application can be extended using user-defined plugins. Plugins can be used to add new commands, modify existing commands, or add new functionality to the application.

As of now, the application only supports plugins defined via local Python modules. Support for [pip-installable plugins](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins/) is planned for a future release.
