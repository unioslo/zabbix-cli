# This module re-treads all the sins of Harbor CLI's state module.
#
# The lazy-loading, properties with setters/getters, and the singleton pattern
# are all code smells in their own ways (lazy-loading maybe less so in a CLI context).
# The sad thing is that this works well, and it's hard to find a good way to configure
# the application once, save that state, then maintain it for the duration
# of the application's lifetime. The only thing we have to be careful about it
# is to ensure we configure the State object before we use it, and perform
# all imports from other modules inside functions, so that we don't create
# circular imports.
#
# For some reason, I am totally blanking on how to do this in a way that doesn't
# suck when using Typer. With Click, it is easy, because we could just use the
# `@pass_obj` decorator to pass the State object to every command, but Typer
# doesn't have anything like that.
#
# We have a bunch of state we need to access in order to determine things like
# authentication, logging, default values, etc. So having them all gathered
# in this one place is convenient.
